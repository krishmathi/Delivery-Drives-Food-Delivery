Design Decisions:

- I created a separate stylesheet for all my design decisions (restaurant.css).
- I added a green to beige gradient along the border of the WebPage.
- Changed the font family to Helvetica, sans-serif to make the page look more visually appealing.
- Added a thin border around the header and a beige glow around the header text and the 3 column layout text.
- Changed the original "add" and "remove" pictures with ones that look more appealing.
- Bolded each menu item text to make it look more distinct between each item.
